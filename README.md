# 🧩 Student Machine Learning Project — [Project Title]

This project was completed as part of my *AEC in Business Intelligence and Visualization Analysis* program.  
It applies basic Machine Learning techniques to solve a real-world inspired problem, using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project was to [predict/classify X — e.g., classify customer churn / predict house prices] using historical data.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 What I did

- Collected and cleaned the dataset.
- Explored and visualized key variables.
- Applied feature engineering to prepare the data.
- Built and trained a [model type, e.g., logistic regression/classification/regression tree].
- Evaluated the model using [accuracy, confusion matrix, RMSE, etc.].
- Interpreted results and presented findings.

---

## ✅ Key Results

- [Example: The model reached an accuracy of 82% on the test data.]
- Identified main factors influencing [target variable].
