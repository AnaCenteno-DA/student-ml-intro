# 🧩 Student Machine Learning Project — Models Comparison

This project was completed as part of my *AEC in Business Intelligence and Visualization Analysis* program.  
It applies basic Machine Learning techniques to solve a real-world inspired problem, using Python and scikit-learn.

---

## 📌 Objective

The goal of this project was to do a project and compare three ML models across two datasets to evaluate performance and select the best performing algorithm.

---

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, NumPy, Matplotlib)
- Colab Notebook

---

## 📊 What I did

- Collected and cleaned the dataset.
- Explored and visualized key variables.
- Applied feature engineering to prepare the data.
- Built and trained a : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
- Evaluated the model using : Accuracy, precision, F1 Score, recall and Confusion Matrix
- Interpreted results and presented findings.

---

## ✅ Key Results

- [Example: The model reached an accuracy of 82% on the test data.]
- Identified main factors influencing target variables on each dataset.
